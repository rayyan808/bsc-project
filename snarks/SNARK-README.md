Zokrates is still in beta phase, due to this I had to seperate the circuits according to where you choose to compile.
Zokrates on Remix-IDE, which I was initially using, requires field type variables in loops
Zokrates-CLI requires u32 type variables in loops.

This causes issues when compiling, so for clarity they have be seperated.
