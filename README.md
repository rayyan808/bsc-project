My Bachelor Project

Progress so far:
- Studied Zokrates Docs
- Studied EVM Docs (Skimmed through, more like)
- Studied Soldiity Docs
- Research complete on Membership Test
- Alpha Code for Membership Test 

- Simple Election Contract with voting and tallying.

- A seperate Merkle contract that is just a mind doodle at this point
- Research on Hash Functions suitable for SNARK and On-Chain use
- On-Chain MiMC Hashing implemented
- Zero-Knowledge MiMC Hashing implemented
- Both MiMC Hash functions synchronized to produce same output (FINALLY!)
- Merkle Generation implemented
- Proof of Membership using ZKP MiMC implemented
- A little insight gained in arithmetic circuits 
- Proof of Membership tested and optimized for circuits (removed some if conditions, removed generic properties such as dynamic tree size due to circuit constraints)
- Verifier Contract produced


Progress left:

- Test Verifier Contract
- DApp
